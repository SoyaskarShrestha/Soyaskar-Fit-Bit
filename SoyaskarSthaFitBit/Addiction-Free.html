      <h2>What is addiction?</h2>
      <h4>
        Addiction is an inability to stop using a substance or engaging in a behavior even though it is causing psychological and physical harm.
      </h4>
      <p>
        The American Society of Addiction Medicine defines addiction as “a treatable, chronic medical disease involving complex interactions among brain circuits, genetics, the environment, and an individual's life experiences. People with addiction use substances or engage in behaviors that become compulsive and often continue despite harmful consequences.”
      </p>
      <p>
        The term addictionTrusted Source does not only refer to dependence on substances such as heroin or cocaine. Some addictions also involve an inability to stop partaking in activities such as gambling, eating, or working.
      </p>
      <p>
        Doctors currently diagnose addictions under a category known as “substance-related and addictive disorders.”
      </p>
      <p>
        Person with a substance use disorder finds it difficult to control their use of a specific substance. They continue using a substance or engaging in addictive behavior, even though they might be aware of the harm it can cause or when clear evidence of harm is apparent.
      </p>
      <p>
        The signs and symptoms of substance use disorder can vary with the individual, the substance or behavior they are overusing, their family history, and their personal circumstances.

    <h2>What are the treatments for addiction?</h2>
    <br>
    <p>
      The first step towards recovery is acknowledging that substance use has become a problem in the person's life which is disrupting the quality of their life. This can result from impairment in school, work, social, recreational or other important areas of function.
    </p>
    <p>
      A person with an addictive disorder requires access to treatment. For most people, treatment may last for the rest of their life. They will need to abstain from the substance on a life-long basis, which can be difficult. Treatment plans for addictive disorders will often change to meet the needs of the patient.
    </p>
    <p>
      Treatment options for addiction depend on several factors, including the type of addictive disorder, the length and severity of use, and its effects on the individual. A doctor will also treat or refer for treatment any physical complications that have developed, such as liver disease in a person with alcohol use disorder or respiratory issues in people with an addiction to substances which have been smoked.
    </p>
    <p>
